Subject: [PATCH] Fix nothing mlg

The issue here is that when jumping and sneaking right before
the end of a long fall, the client will send incorrect move
packets resulting in a teleport back. Due to this, the move
packet (impact) of the player will not be considered for fall
damage. The following move packet to the impact packet will
have a positive y-value again due to the player jumping,
resulting in a fall damage reset.

Solution: Apply fall damage also while moving wrongly, but
supply the real values the player sent to the damage calculation.
This will not have any real negative effect, as the
doCheckFallDamage method is meant to be called repeatedly anyway.
