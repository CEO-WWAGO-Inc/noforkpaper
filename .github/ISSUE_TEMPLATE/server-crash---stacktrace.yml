        We need all of the stack trace! Do not cut off parts of it. Please do not use attachments.
        Please use a paste site like https://paste.gg.
        Please do not make reports when the report says "DO NOT REPORT THIS TO PAPER". These are simply messages informing you of lag, to find what is causing it. Ask for tips on Discord or IRC instead.
