Subject: [PATCH] Disable sending CommandMap to players on world change

Often, but not 100% of the time, the server will reconstruct and recalculate the Command Map sent to players
when they change worlds. This is often laggy; worse-so depending on the extent of the tab-completed commands to be sent.
In our case, the map sent to the player on login is sufficient and is not tossed by the client for world changes.

As a result, we opt not to send this on world change and this prevents a fairly heavy, and consistent main-thread
lagspike whenever players change worlds, which can be a lot.
