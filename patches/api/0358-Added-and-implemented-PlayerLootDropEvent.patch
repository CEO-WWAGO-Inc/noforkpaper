Subject: [PATCH] Added and implemented PlayerLootDropEvent.

As a result of how the PlayerDeathEvent was implemented, when a player dies their items are simply dropped
through the "world.dropItem()" method. This makes it very annoying for plugin developers to ultimately
track down the Item entities dropped when a player dies. This patch implements a "PlayerLootDropEvent",
making it easy for developers to track down the Item entities dropped when a player dies. Furthermore,
Item entities dropped on player death are marked as being thrown by the player that died.
